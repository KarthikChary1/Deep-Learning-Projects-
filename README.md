I Wanna Just say one thing to all...


we are not a storage device to store data and use the same thing everywhere.
Just we have to gain knowledge regarding the working concept of things 
and one more thing---> Forgetting things is a Human thing
so no need to worry about this things , just know that why you are starting and how this helps out to people and if you stuck anywhere just Google the Stuff 
take advantage as much as possible ,that's it.
